//Projects consists of main product card, divided in 3 html blocks.
//Separate components were used for product review star rating, countdown timer for discount and quantity rockers for product options.
//1. For project I used vue.js (because it is more friendly for beginners and I before used only plain Javascript with a bit of jQery and alpine.js);
//2. In vue,js I included axios for easier API data fetching;
//3. Used Git Bash to create repository and push changes;
//This was my first time using this framework and styling everything like this (before I heavily relied on Tailwind.css). I feel that a lot of stuff I've done could be done better with more knowledge and experience, but I learned a lot just by doing this. Thank you for this opportunity!
